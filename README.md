Friends
=======

*Remember stuff from people that matters to you.*

Manage things that you want to remember about your loved ones.

This app may come in handy if:

* You always forget whether your fellow friend is allergic to parsley or chive.
* Your friends keep hinting you about possible gifts but you can't recall it
  from memory when it's time to buy something for them.
* You want to invite a new friend and you can't remember whether she prefers
  wine or beer.
